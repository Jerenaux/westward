# Westward

Westward is an open-source aspiring MMORPG written in Javascript. The game is not online at the moment as the project is not actively maintained anymore.

**Disclaimer**: Westward began as a closed-source project, and has grown that way for more than 2 years. As a result, the current codebase
is messy and not very collaboration-friendly. Documentation is sorely missing, the tests are a mess, and the code itself looks like
what a 2+ years codebase maintained by one guy can look like. You can make that change! I invite you to point out where the code is particularly 
unclear and where the lack of documentation is particularly painful. I will give top priority to addressing these feedbacks. 

## Vision

As a **game**, Westward aims to be a collaborative MMORPG where the players have to build a nation, starting from scratch and progressively
settling a large continent. A more lengthy description can be found on the [description page of the game](https://www.dynetisgames.com/2018/03/04/westward/).

As an **open-source project**, Westward aims to be a great collaborative experience for contributors of all sorts. The goal is also
to be a learning experience, for me as well as for developpers interested in gamedev. I hope the contributions and the community will grow into
a space for us to learn and have fun improving that game.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
At some point a Docker image should be rolled out to facilitate that process (feel free to contribute on that front if that's your area of expertise!)

### Prerequisites

- A recent version of Node.js
- A MongoDB instance listening on port `27017`

### Installing

Clone this repository, then navigate to it and install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

You should also create a file called `.env` at the root of the directory. This is where the `dotenv` package will be looking for
environment variables. Your local version doesn't need to define any environment variables, but `dotenv` will complain if that
file is missing. 

```
touch .env
```

## Running the game

The most straightforward way ton run the game server is to do:

```
node dist/server.js
```

Then navigate to `localhost:8081` to play the game.

If you make modifications to the game, don't forget to rebuild it using webpack, which you can do by running:

```
npm run webpack
```

Alternatively you can run `webpack-dev-server` to automatically watch for changes and rebuild when changes are detected. You can do so by running:

```
npm run watch:webpack
```

The file `package.json` defines all the `npm run ...` commands that are available. Feel free to add more if you think that would be useful!

## Running the tests

Some tests have been set up, mainly focusing on testing the client/server API and some internal server functions. They can be run as follows:

```
npm run test
```

These tests could be improved in a million ways, by being better documented, being more clean, or simply by adding more tests. In
an ideal world, the tests could act as a gateway to the codebase, providing a clear view of what is going on and helping contributors
dive in. It's not the case yet, but feel free to contribute on that front!

## Deployment

The master branch of this repository is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance maintained by myself. I will not elaborate too
much on that aspect since it doesn't impact contributions, but I can provide more information if there is demand for it.
